# deNOVOEnrich
Identification of de novo transposon insertion sites from targeted sequencing data generated through Transposon display Sequencing (TEd-Seq)


**Overview**

deNOVOEnrich is a computational pipeline designed to efficiently detect and profile genome-wide somatic transposition events, as well as non-reference fixed TE insertions from targeted sequencing data generated through Transposon display sequencing (TEd-Seq).
