# deNOVOEnrich
Identification of de novo transposon insertion sites from targeted sequencing data generated through Transposon display Sequencing (TEd-Seq)


##**Overview**

deNOVOEnrich is a computational pipeline designed to efficiently detect and profile genome-wide somatic transposition events, as well as non-reference fixed TE insertions from targeted sequencing data generated through Transposon display sequencing (TEd-Seq). 
The pipeline uses high-confidence split reads to identify TE:genome break sites to determine bona-fide non-reference somatic and
