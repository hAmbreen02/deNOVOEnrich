# deNOVOEnrich
Identification of de novo transposon insertion sites from targeted sequencing data generated through Transposon display Sequencing (TEd-Seq)


## **Overview**

deNOVOEnrich is a computational pipeline developed to efficiently detect and profile genome-wide somatic transposition insertions, as well as non-reference heritable transposition events from targeted sequencing data generated through Transposon display sequencing (TEd-Seq). 

The pipeline leverages high-confidence split read alignments to identify TE:genome break sites, enabling accurate detection of bona-fide non-reference somatic and heritable new insertions of a transposon. Highly stringent filters were applied at each step of the pipeline to ensure the removal of false positives and the reduction of background noise signal.
